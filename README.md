# âœ¨ Stainless product engineer boilerplate

**Before** your interview:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

A React app should start at: `http://localhost:5173`

You should see a "Your code goes here!" message on that page.

Further instructions to be given in realtime during the interview.

Good luck!
